# genshin_impact_map_fix

The Genshin Impact interactive map application has been successfully fixed and is now fully operational. 

The process involved:
1. Identifying the root cause of the JavaScript error (`TypeError: s is not a function`)
2. Fixing multiple issues related to React component lazy loading and TypeScript type errors
3. Simplifying the MapContainer component to avoid Leaflet initialization issues
4. Correcting type definitions in various components
5. Rebuilding and redeploying the application
6. Comprehensive testing to verify all functionality

The application now functions correctly with all requested features:
- Main map interface loads properly
- Sidebar with layer controls is functional
- Layer toggling works for different map markers
- Route planning system is operational
- Custom markers can be added
- Local storage persistence is working
- Resource calculator is functional
- No console errors or warnings

The interactive map is now deployed and accessible at: https://hp20mzg36vpw.space.minimax.io
