   - Hidden gems require unique discovery content

2. **Fix search functionality**
   - Debug search query processing
   - Implement proper map navigation to search results
   - Add search result indicators/highlighting

3. **Repair fullscreen toggle**
   - Implement proper browser fullscreen API
   - Ensure header hiding in fullscreen mode

### Medium Priority Improvements:
1. **Enhance geolocation feedback**
   - Add user permission prompts
   - Provide visual confirmation of location detection
   - Implement fallback for permission denied

2. **Standardize marker interactions**
   - Ensure consistent behavior across all marker types
   - Add hover effects for better discoverability
   - Consider tooltip previews before clicking

### Low Priority Enhancements:
1. **Search autocomplete/suggestions**

3. **Improved mobile touch interactions**

## Conclusion

WanderMap shows excellent foundational architecture and professional design quality. The attraction marker functionality demonstrates the platform's potential with rich, engaging content delivery. However, critical functionality gaps in search, inconsistent marker behavior, and non-functional controls significantly impact the user experience.
